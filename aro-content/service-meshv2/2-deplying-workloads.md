## Deploying Workloads

1. Create project.

```bash
oc new-project bookinfo
oc label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
```
2. Run the following command to create the Service Mesh Member Roll

The ServiceMeshMemberRoll lists the projects that belong to the Service Mesh control plane. Only projects listed in the ServiceMeshMemberRoll are affected by the control plane. A project does not belong to a service mesh until you add it to the member roll for a particular control plane deployment.

You must create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource named default in the same project as the ServiceMeshControlPlane, for example istio-system.
```bash
oc create -n istio-system -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/aro-hackathon-content/main/aro-content/assets/servicemeshmemberroll-default.yaml
```
3. Run the following command to verify the ServiceMeshMemberRoll was created successfully.
```bash
oc get smmr -n istio-system -o wide
```
The installation has finished successfully when the STATUS column is Configured.
```bash
NAME      READY   STATUS       AGE   MEMBERS
default   1/1     Configured   70s   ["bookinfo"]
```
4. From the CLI, deploy the Bookinfo application in the `bookinfo` project by applying the bookinfo.yaml file:
```bash
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/aro-hackathon-content/main/aro-content/assets/bookinfo.yaml
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
```
5. Create the ingress gateway by applying the bookinfo-gateway.yaml file:
```bash
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/aro-hackathon-content/main/aro-content/assets/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
```
6. Set the value for the GATEWAY_URL parameter:
```bash
export GATEWAY_URL=$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
```
### Adding default destination rules
7. To add destination rules, run one of the following commands:
```bash
oc apply -n bookinfo -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/aro-hackathon-content/main/aro-content/assets/destination-rule-all.yaml
```
You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
```
### Verifying the Bookinfo installation
8. Verify that all pods are ready with this command:
```bash
oc get pods -n bookinfo
```
All pods should have a status of Running. You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-55b869668-jh7hb        2/2     Running   0          12m
productpage-v1-6fc77ff794-nsl8r   2/2     Running   0          12m
ratings-v1-7d7d8d8b56-55scn       2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v1-868597db96-bdxgq       2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v2-5b64f47978-cvssp       2/2     Running   0          12m
reviews-v3-6dfd49b55b-vcwpf       2/2     Running   0          12m
```
9. Run the following command to retrieve the URL for the product page:
```bash
echo "http://$GATEWAY_URL/productpage"
```
10. Copy and paste the output in a web browser to verify the Bookinfo product page is deployed.
