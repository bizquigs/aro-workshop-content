- Use Azure Arc for logging and monitoring of OpenShift and containerized applications

### Development track:

- Deploy an application that uses an Azure Managed Database
- Learn how to use OpenShift Service Mesh for application observability and tracing
- Make an application on OpenShift scalable and resistant to node failures and upgrades
